    "## Preprocessing of the tweets\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to execute the different steps in order to clean the Sentiment140 dataset.\n",
    "here are the pre-processing steps we are going to perform :\n",
    "1. __HTML decoding__: In our text field the HTML encoding has not yet been converted to text, and to avoid having “&amp” ,”&quot”, ect in the text field. Decoding HTML is processed with the python BeautifulSoup library.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. __Usernames__: Users often include Twitter usernames in their tweets in order to direct their messages using the @user mention. We believe that this does not give insights in the sentiment classification of the tweet and therefore we removed users mentions.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. __Usage of links__: Users very often include links in their tweets, just like including usernames, it doesn’t help for sentiment classification and therefore we removed it using regex patterns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. __Hashtag__: Sometimes the text used with hashtag can provide useful information about the tweet. It might be a bit risky to get rid of all the text together with the hashtag. So we decided to leave the text intact and just remove the ‘#’. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "5. __Handling negation__: we built a dictionary where we mapped every negation word with it’s splitted form like “musn’t” : “must not” , “haven’t” : “have not”.\n"
